# Tools for Planning, Design and Communication in Landscape Architecture 

## From Conventional Approaches to Virtual Reality



### What is the Research Aim?

To describe the motivations behind different tool sets used in Landscape architecture, and they interact with projects and participants



### How is XR is Used?

The paper records the first impressions of VR as a medium in Landscape architecture.

#### What type of XR

Mobile Headset VR with a series of fixed scenarios

Oculus Rift for demonstrating large scale land forms.

#### What Technology Stack

Both Mobile and PC VR is discussed, with mobile VR being most useful outside the office.

### Results?

People hesitant to VR became more receptive after an initial usage.

Participants most experienced with VR where the most critical saying being able to see something in 3D will have an effect, but not a revolutionary one.

"If I can have different choices build in this then it could be interesting." as "its easier to create renders and show some pre defined points."

It has the disadvantage of time, as there is a bottle neck in getting models into VR.

"With the tools we have now it is too much work to put a headset on and walk around an environment"

Visualisation has been used for specific sites for impact in public spaces where scale is hard to grasp.

The exclusion of other senses is an issue, and the perceived lack of discussion while in VR.

It is very effective to show the final design product, and allows a sense of wowness.

### Impact for us

VR is seen as a way to accidently minimise communication and discussion, perhaps this is where AR will shine
