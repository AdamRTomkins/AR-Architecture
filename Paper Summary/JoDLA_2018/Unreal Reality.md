## An Empirical Investigation of Augmented Reality Effects on Spatial Cognition in Landscape Architecture



### What is the Research Aim?

Premise is that AR is a tool to help spatial cognition of users. Using an AR set up in an outdoor space they aim to examine the useful ness of three competing AR experiences through the lens of Degrees of Freedom.

They Propose that additional degrees of freedom afforded by AR such as rotation and translation, with constructive affect the spatial cognition of landscape architecture intervention in terms of spatial visualization, exploration, and provision of meaning of space.

*Conversely the reduction of degrees of freedom will limit spatial experience, conditioning the users spatial cognition of the intervention.*

### How is XR is Used?

#### What type of XR

Mobile Augmented Reality with Multiple Tracked Markers.

Uses three different 'Degree of Freedom' types:

1. 360 degree multiple sided marker.
2. rotation only single spot, multiple marker,
3. Markered Pathway, translation, no rotation

#### What Technology Stack

Vuforia Unity SDK on iPad Air



### Case Study

The restraints of the case study where:

1. It must be implemented in an existing space, and interact with it.

2. Must be located in an outdoor location

3. It has to contribute to the improvement of the existent situation

4. It has to allow different exploration scenarios to compare affects on spatial cognition.

   

As such the following scenarios where created:

1. 360 Orbit Marker as a cube
2. Panoramic 150 degree rotation from a static position using three markers
3. Full freedom with several markers positioned in a path 3 meters apart.

Markers where places in stationary places on sticks.

Data collection was broken into two steps, on site, and offsite.

Onsite Stage:

1. Visualise and Explore, with a 5 minute window, the AR intervention using the given handheld device.
2. Take 5 screenshots during the time which stood out, for positive or negative reasons.

Offsite Stage:

1. Draw an plan view of the AR intervention from a base with reference lines, in 5 mins.
2. Draw a cross section of the AR intervention facing the adjacent building, with no reference. 
3. Answer a questionnaire

### Results?

Full 360 rotation was the best for general accuracy, with the 150 Panorama that worst, when given guidelines such as reference marks or landmarks.

As such views close to landmarks where drawn much more accurately.

Translation add more to spatial cognition than rotation, in the absence of guidelines, as walking around enables body cues to judge distance.

Criticisms include occlusion, and software tracking in poor lighting.

Handheld AR effects spatial cognition in 3 ways;

1. providing meaning to space, allowing people to discover new possible uses for apace.
2. Fosting exploration which enables intergration of body cues when having a spatial experience.
3. affecting users spatial visualisation and their relations distributed in space.

Users found AR to be a positive experience, and demand rotation more than translation.

Translation was between to create a spatial cognition through walking, but rotation gave a better understanding when given context landmarks to work with.

As such the position of the viewer in relation to the intervention is as important as the Degrees of Freedom

### Impact for us

AR can be used to bridge the Spatial Understanding gap between designers and stakeholders, an obstacle when trying to create a shared understanding and vision of landscape architecture designs, affecting participation, consensus and decisions.

AR can compliment users spatial visualisation, providing clarity, insight and design understanding.

We can tailor any experiences with the requirements of this study in mind, such as the location of viewer in relation to the intervention.
