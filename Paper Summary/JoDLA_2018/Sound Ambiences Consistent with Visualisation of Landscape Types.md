# Sound Ambiences Consistent  with Visualisations of Landscape Types 

## An Evaluation



### What is the Research Aim?

To determine how auditory keys effect landscape perception, with the aim of increasing simulation quality.

Demonstrate how to reproduce experimental sounds for visual representations,measuring consistency and experience support.

### How is XR is Used?

#### What type of XR

360 panoramas and a 3-screen wall projection.

#### What Technology Stack

Static Image projection

### Results?

Sounds are incredibly important for believability, both individual sounds (sound marks) and generic ambient sounds. Interestingly lab participants expect a different level of sound that recorded on site.

Sounds should be selects based on saliency and frequency. Sounds with cultural markers like bells are first noticed.

### Impact for us

We may need to consider sound design in landscape XR applications, which is currently unknown in the AR field.
