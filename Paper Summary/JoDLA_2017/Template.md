# Testing the Effectiveness of Augmented Reality in the Public Participation Process

# A Case Study in  the City of Bernburg 



### What is the Research Aim?

Investigate the role of AR in a case study bringing the technology into a public participation frame to gauge how they interact. They use Bernburg, a city of 27,000 people in Saxony Anhalt, as it has different sites of historic interest.

The river back has been repeatedly flooded, and as such is being redesigned a monument of 4 columns has been stored away in the process.

The intervention will restore this monument to its original place, and add two lines of tress to better define the space.



They compared a photomontage approach with AR in-place models.

### How is XR is Used?

They use two tablets, attuned to different images, one on a table to inspect the columns, and another fixed to a railing with the aim of putting the columns in their real position.

#### What type of XR

Marker based tracked AR



#### What Technology Stack

Likey Vuforia or any basic tracked technology.



### Results?

People found AR easy to use, but still prefered Photomontages in general, but AR is acceptable.

### Impact for us

Nearly 72 % of the participants showed an increase in  their  interest  of  participating  in  more  in  planning  initiatives  after  using  AR,  from  them  66% had never before participated in a public participation activity; on the other hand 18.3 % using AR did not increase their interest in participating in planning initiatives.
